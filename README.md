# Citibike Analysis using Python
### Utilizing Python, I conduct an analysis of Citibike NYC (2022) data in order to provide meaningful insight into rider data and seasonal effect on rider habits. Attached are Jupyter Workbooks, as well as the .py file for the Final Streamlit Dashboard.

## Background:
#### Citibike is a bicycle rental service with several membership and rideable types. They service many metropolitan areas, including NYC. The primary pain point is limited bicycle availabity. This analysis encompasses several factors that can impact aforementioned availability and proposes recommendations to facilitate CitiBike's success in the future. 


## Key Questions:
- How much would you recommend scaling bikes back between November and April?
- How could you determine how many more stations to add along the water?
- What are some ideas for ensuring bikes are always stocked at the most popular stations?		
- Plus, additional personalized recommendations based on my findings.

## Data and Tools:
#### The data set was provided by Citibike and has been analyzed with Python. All visualizations in the final presentation were created with Python, including the script for the Streamlit App / Dashboard.

## Project Deliverables:
#### Access the final dashboard [here](https://citibike-dash.streamlit.app/)).
